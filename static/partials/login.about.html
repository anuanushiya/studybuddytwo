    <br />
    <p>The studybuddy app is designed to help you to connect with other students who may be studying the same subject matter.
        It was developed with the intention to increase student networks and to help students to work together to learn from each other.
        Studying shouldn’t and doesn’t have to be done alone. <br /><br/>
